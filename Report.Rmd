## Introduction

This is the finished assignment described in multiple parts. Answers to all the questions were detailed below.The 9 items were also commented inside the R code blocks. This is a single R markdown document that can be processed by knitr and be transformed into an HTML file.


## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r, echo = TRUE }
## Loading and preprocessing the data 
library(tidyverse)
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")

library("lubridate")
# 1. Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data 
activity2 <- mutate(activity, ymd(date))
names(activity2)[4] <- "date2" 
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


```{r echo= TRUE}
TotalStepsPerDay <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```


Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day


```{r echo = TRUE}
#2.Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
qplot(TotalStepsPerDay, xlab='Total Steps Per day', ylab='Frequency', binwidth=400)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?


```{r echo = TRUE}
#3. Mean and median number of steps taken each day
# Mean
stepsByDayMean <- mean(TotalStepsPerDay)
stepsByDayMean
# Meidan
stepsByDayMedian <- median(TotalStepsPerDay)
stepsByDayMedian
```


Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis). 

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
averageStepsPerTimeBlock <- aggregate(x=list(meanSteps=activity$steps), by=list(interval=activity$interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)

mostSteps <- which.max(averageStepsPerTimeBlock$meanSteps)
timeMostSteps <-  gsub("([0-9]{1,2})([0-9]{2})", "\\1:\\2", averageStepsPerTimeBlock[mostSteps,'interval'])

```

## Imputing missing values
Imputing missing values


Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as 𝙽𝙰). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.


Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset

```{r}


numMissingValues <- length(which(is.na(activity$steps)))

```

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 

```{r}

```


Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? 

```{r}

```

What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```{r}

```



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r echo = TRUE}

#making a time series plot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=averageStepsPerTimeBlock, aes(x=interval, y=meanSteps)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab("5-minute interval") +
    ylab("average number of steps taken") 



#Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.


library(scales)
library(Hmisc)
activityDataImputed <- activity
activityDataImputed$steps <- impute(activity$steps, fun=mean) # impute {Hmisc} a function to use in computing the (single) imputed value from the non-NAs

#Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
stepsByDayImputed <- tapply(activityDataImputed$steps, activityDataImputed$date, sum)
qplot(stepsByDayImputed, xlab='Total steps per day (Imputed)', ylab='Frequency using binwith 500', binwidth=500)

#and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
stepsByDayMeanImputed <- mean(stepsByDayImputed)
stepsByDayMedianImputed <- median(stepsByDayImputed)

```





For this part the 𝚠𝚎𝚎𝚔𝚍𝚊𝚢𝚜() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.


```{r echo = TRUE}
# Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
activityDataImputed$dateType <-  ifelse(as.POSIXlt(activityDataImputed$date)$wday %in% c(0,6), 'weekend', 'weekday')
## Make a panel plot containing a time series plot

averagedActivityDataImputed <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dateType, data=activityDataImputed, mean)
ggplot(averagedActivityDataImputed, aes(interval, steps)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    facet_grid(dateType ~ .) +
    xlab("5-minute interval") + 
    ylab("avarage number of steps")


```
